but not waterloggedn the amount and frequency of irrigation will depend on factors such as soil type weather conditions and the growth stage of the rice plantn in general rice should be irrigated when the soil moisture level drops to about  of field capacityn during the vegetative stage rice should be irrigated every  daysn during the reproductive stage rice should be irrigated every  daysn during the grainfilling stage rice should be irrigated every  daysn it is important to avoid water stress during the flowering and grainfilling stages as this can lead to reduced yieldsn overwatering can

directly to the roots of plants through a network of pipes and emitters it can reduce water use by up to  compared to traditional flood  mulching mulching involves covering the soil around plants with a layer of organic material such as straw or leaves this can help to reduce evaporation and retain soil  crop rotation crop rotation involves alternating the crops grown in a particular field from season to season this can help to reduce water use by reducing the demand for waterintensive  conservation tillage conservation tillage involves reducing the amount of tillage or plowing done in a field this can help to reduce soil erosion and improve soil moisture  rainwater harvesting rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing rainwater for later use this can be done using techniques such as rooftop rainwater harvesting or constructing small ponds or  use of droughttolerant crops planting crops that are adapted to dry conditions can help to reduce water use and improve yields in areas with limited water  improved irrigation scheduling using tools such as soil moisture sensors or weather forecasts can help farmers to optimize irrigation scheduling and reduce water  use of wastewater treating and reusing wastewater for irrigation can help to reduce the demand for freshwater  use of cover crops cover crops are planted between main crops to help improve soil health

loss due to evaporation and  reduced water use micro irrigation systems can reduce water use by up to  compared to traditional flood irrigation methods this is because water is delivered directly to the root zone of plants reducing the amount of water lost to evaporation and  improved crop yield micro irrigation systems can improve crop yield by ensuring that plants receive the right amount of water they need this can help to reduce water stress and improve plant growth and  reduced energy use micro irrigation systems require less energy to operate compared to traditional flood irrigation methods this is because they use lowpressure water delivery systems which require less energy to pump  reduced labor costs micro irrigation systems require less labor to operate compared to

Condensing all that information in 2 dimensions is simply not possible.

We can either save the entire model with `pickle`, `pytorch` or `safetensors`. When saving a model with `safetensors`, it skips over saving the dimensionality reduction and clustering models.
